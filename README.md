# TuringMachine

TuringMachine is a JavaScript project for creating and running Turing machines. It allows you to define tapes, states, and transitions to simulate tasks like binary increment, complement, and addition.

## Features

- Create custom Turing machines with specified tapes, states, and transitions.
- Simulate Turing machines step-by-step or until a final state is reached.
- Includes examples for incrementing binary numbers, computing binary complements, and adding binary numbers.

## Usage

Check the examples in the repository to see how to create and run different Turing machines.
